Abstract: Purpose: COVID-19 pandemic aftermaths include the emergence of new tendencies, such as the Quiet Quitting,
and  continuation  of  trends  such  as  the  Great  Resignation,  both  of  which  have  multiple  knowledge-related  impacts  on
individual,  organizational  and  even  national  level.  The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  show  the  mechanisms  behind  the  Quiet
Quitting and the Great Resignation from individual and organizational perspectives. Understanding them is the first step to
developing remedies and building business resilience. Methodology: The paper uses systems thinking approach to analyse
the phenomena of the Quiet Quitting. Causal loop diagrams are used to show the mechanisms behind those tendencies,
their antecedents and the impact they have on several aspects of business operation and management. Findings: The Quiet
Quitting  and  the  Great  Resignation  are  multifaceted  phenomena  and  pose  several  knowledge-related  dangers  to
organizations,  including  disturbed  knowledge  flows,  knowledge  loss,  diminished  efficiency,  lost  informal  friendship
networks,  and  knowledge  leakage  to  competition.  Causal  loop  diagram  indicates  that  complicated  relations  between
various elements may produce surprising and unexpected outcomes. It presents also opportunities to use leverage points
in order to substantially reduce negative outcomes. Research limitations: The paper is of a conceptual nature. In order to
transform causal loop diagrams into full systems thinking models extensive data is required. Hence this paper is intended
as a basis for further research. Practical implications: The understanding of mechanisms behind the Great Resignation and
the Quiet Quitting is crucial for managers trying to develop strategies that would tackle those problems. The papers shows
what leverage points can be used to mitigate risks of their adverse impact on business organizations. Originality/value: The
Great Resignation and the Quiet Quitting are often perceived as results of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet data suggest they
remain strong also in the post-pandemic business reality. The paper offers a holistic approach to those phenomena using
individual  and  organisational  perspectives.  It  provides  important  insights  into  their  nature,  which  can  be  useful  to
numerous stakeholders, including knowledge workers, managers and business owners.

Introduction

Both Quiet Quitting and Great Resignation pose a serious problem in contemporary economies. Nonetheless,
many  organisations  are  unprepared  to  handle  the  problem,  or  they  lack  abilities  and  willingness  to  do  so.
Today’s  leaders  fail  in  this  matter  and  as  a  result,  the  number  of  quiet  quitters  grows  (Smith,  2022).  Quiet
Quitting spreads through the world of academia (Morrison-Beedy, 2022), social workers (Scheyett, 2022) and
finance (Constantz, 2022), just to name a few. A recent survey carried out by Qualtrics indicates that between
2021  and  2022  the  share  of  workers  trying  their  hardest  to  do  good  job  for  the  company  they  work  for
diminished  in  14  out  of  15  U.S.  industries.  The  greatest  changes  appeared  in  “Finance  and  Insurance”,  “Art,
Entertainment and Recreation”, “Accommodations and Food Services” as well as “Professional, Scientific and
Technical  Services”  (Constantz,  2022).  In  those  industries  knowledge  is  an  important  resource,  making
Knowledge  Management  (KM)  and  Knowledge  Sharing  (KS)  vital  processes  for  most  companies  operating
there.

Knowledge is the most valuable resource that contemporary organizations may possess. It is the foundation of
intangible assets, routines and creative processes that are difficult to imitate (Renzl, 2008). Proper Knowledge
Management  is  the  source  of  sustainable  comparative  advantage.  Knowledge  Management  is  vital  for  the
development  of  new  technologies,  products  and  services.  It  also  facilitates  organisational  performance
improvements, when people exchange information, best practices, insights and experiences (Renzl, 2008).

Knowledge  Sharing  (KS)  is  a  phenomenon  already  deeply  rooted  in  in  the  field  of  Knowledge  Management
(Boer, 2005;  Zheng, 2017).  Schwartz (2006)  defines  it  conveniently  as “the  exchange  of  knowledge  between
and among individuals, and within and among teams, organizational units, and organization”. KS is a voluntary
activity,  hence  apart  from  its  technical  aspects  (such  as  know-how  or  technology),  willingness  to  share
experiences  is  vital.  Such  willingness  calls  for  trust  among  people  involved  in  the  KS  process  (Bolisani  and
Bratianu, 2018) and this trust is an indispensable factor for successful KS (Ogunmokun et al., 2020). While the
complexity  of  tasks  that  are  handled  by  employees  increases,  it  is  required  to  rely  on  interdisciplinary
approach more than ever. That makes knowledge sharing even more important and useful for organizations
(Cummings, 2004), but it does not make knowledge sharing easy (Argote & Ingram, 2000).

This paper addresses the following research questions: How do the Great Resignation and the Quiet Quitting
impact Knowledge Management and Knowledge Sharing in contemporary organizations? What can be done at
individual and organizational level to mitigate the risks and negative consequences of those phenomena? The
paper tries to answer those questions using Systems Thinking theory.

Systems Thinking is a term having a few meanings. It can be treated as a perspective, a language or as a set of
tools,  which  include  causal  loops  used  in  the  model  presented  in  this  paper.  Systems  Thinking  is  defined  as
opposite to linear thinking and offers holistic approach to the analysed phenomena. Its possible applications
span across various fields and disciplines (Monat and Gannon, 2015).

Systems  thinking  can  be  also  perceived  as  a  valuable  methodology,  particularly  suitable  for  Knowledge
Management-related considerations (Rubenstein-Montano et al., 2001; Cavaleri, 2005), offering new ways of
thinking  and  a  useful  toolbox  on  different  levels  and  phases  of  Knowledge  Management  for  practical
knowledge users (Gao, li and Nakamori, 2002).

The  paper  develops  as  follow.  In  the  first  part  the  Great  Resignation  is  introduced  and  its  economic
consequences  are  presented.  This  is  followed  by  a  discussion  on  its  implications  for  KM  at  individual  and
organizational levels. This part is concluded by proposed remedies. The second part is dedicated to the Quiet
Quitting,  presenting  the  scale  of  this  phenomenon  and  its  reasons.  On  the  basis  of  literature,  the  Quiet
Quitting model is presented and explained. The model is then used to show possible ways of preventing and
reducing the Quiet Quitting in organizations. The paper is summed up by a brief concluding part.

2.  Great Resignation

The Great Resignation is a term coined by Anthony Klotz, referring to a surprisingly high number of employees
quitting their jobs since March 2021. For any economy some job turnover is quite natural, but the scale of this
turnover  associated  with  the  Great  Resignation  is  much  more  above  that.  For  the  US  economy,  the  usual
turnover is slightly above 2% and even during the time of COVID-19 pandemic employees used to stick to their
jobs. During the recovery, however, the voluntary turnover rate increased first to 2.6% (as of March 2021), and
later to 3.0% by the end of 2021. The aggregated data does not show the real problem, though. Over half a
year, from March till September 2021, the turnover rate in accommodation and food services sector oscillated
around 6.0%, resulting in the total loss of more than 40% of workforce in this sector. Over the same period of
time, knowledge-intensive professional and business services sector lost a quarter of its workforce (BLS, 2021).
High  resignation  rates  are  also  reported  in  engineering,  technology  and  healthcare  –  all  of  them  quite
knowledge-intensive industries (Cook, 2021; Rozgus, 2021). To make matters worse, this trend is not restricted
to the USA. There is evidence suggesting the UK experiencing similar problems and other Western European
countries may also be affected (YPluse, 2021).

The changes observed here are not purely of a quantitative nature. They are qualitative as well. Malmendier
(2021) suggests that COVID-19 pandemic changed affective, cognitive and also behavioural processes. Hence,
many  employees  may  be  reluctant  to  returning  to  their  usual  office  work,  as  they  have  realised  that
commuting is tiresome and wasteful process. Additionally, the COVID-19 related lockdown allowed people to
re-evaluate  their  life  priorities  and  log-term  career  goals.  As  a  result,  many  employees  accelerated  their
retirement  plans,  are  more  oriented  towards  maintaining  work-life  balance  than  before,  and  determined  to
reduce burnout (Dean and Hoff, 2021; Hsu, 2021; Kaplan, 2021; Thompson 2021).

Although  it  remains  unknown  whether  the  Great  Resignation  would  prove  to  be  a  fundamental  social  shift
with  great  economic  impact  or  just  significant,  yet  temporary  event,  its  importance  is  already  noted.  Toxic
corporate  culture  is  often  blamed  in  this  context  and  this  view  offers  also  some  strategies  for  employees
retention (Sull et al. 2022). Preserving the existing workforce by creating a supportive environment as well as
proactive  addressing  their  concerns  are  suggested  as  very  important  (Hirsch,  2021;  Sheather  and  Slattery,
2021).

Looking  through  the  lenses  of  knowledge  management,  the  Great  Resignation  may  have  profound
implications, both at individual and organisational levels. At the individual level, COVID-19 triggered lockdowns
resulted  in  a  sudden  shift  to  new  communication  and  collaboration  practices.  Remote  work  spilled  over  to
external  collaboration  with  business  partners,  suppliers  or  major  customers.  Understaffing,  experienced  by
organizations  due  to  the  wave  of  resignations,  prompted  managers  to  look  for  workers  outside  the
traditionally defined boundaries of organizations. Missing workforce started to be replaced by freelancers or
independent contractors supporting the trends already existing in the labour market. Between 2005 and 2015
in the US economy, the share alternative work arrangements, such as temporary help agency workers, on-call

1517 Proceedings of the 24th European Conference on Knowledge Management, ECKM 2023Krzysztof Zieba

workers, contract workers, independent workers and freelancers increased by 50% (Katz and Krueger, 2019).
Research shows that in post-pandemic times more than 50% of managers believes that the growing reliance
on freelancers is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and at the same time more than 70% of them declares
they  intend  to  maintain  or  increase  this  reliance  in  their  organizations  in  the  near  future  (Ozimek,  2021).
Remote workers also feel their organizational ties loosen and the character of their work becomes more like
freelancing as well. Most employees who work remotely may be considered as knowledge workers. The above
mentioned  trends  strengthen  their  position  in  labour  market  and  labour  market  for  their  skills  grows.
Knowledge workers become more aware of the fact that their main capital is knowledge, and that their career
is  actually  based  and  dependent  on  personal  knowledge  management.  Personal  knowledge  management
differs  from  the  traditional  organizational  knowledge  management,  as  it  places  an  individual  far  above  the
organization. The process of personal knowledge management development will call for new and/or improved
approaches  and  methods  of  knowledge  accumulation,  retaining  and  application.  Individual,  personal
perspective of knowledge management will present a challenge both to employees and organizations.

From  the  organizational  perspective,  the  Great  Resignation  certainly  means  knowledge  loss,  as  employees
equipped  with  valuable  knowledge  leave  and  at  least  some  of  their  knowledge  cannot  be  retained
(Massingham,  2018).  The  consequences,  however,  are  broader.  Organizational  capability  to  integrate  the
knowledge  of  the  remaining  employees  in  business  processes  may  be  undermined.  Missing  elements  in
knowledge-based  value  creation  process  are  difficult  to replace  and  even  if  it  is  possible,  it  takes  time.  As  a
result,  organizations  may  lose  their  competitive  advantage.  Moreover,  massive  loss  of  knowledge  workers
impedes  both  intra-organizational  and  inter-organizational  knowledge  flows.  In  case  of  intra-organizational
knowledge flows, the problem arises when quitters possessed important know-how and know-what (as they
most  likely  handled  a  lot  of internal  inquiries)  or  know-who (in  which  case  they  served  as nodes  connecting
various  employees. As for  inter-organizational  knowledge  flows,  they  may become disturbed because  of  the
loss of the relational capital. The capability of organizations to interact with external stakeholders is inter alia
dependent  on  the  knowledge  embedded  in  the  relations  that  used  to  be  maintained  (Mention  and  Bontis,
2013). Personal connections that quitters had are gone with them and it may take a lot of time to rebuild them
(DeLong, 2004).

The  remedies  are  problematic.  In  the  short-run,  the  human  capital  that  is  still  available  to  organizations,
should  be  used  in  the  most  efficient  possible  way.  Hiring  is  obviously  the  first  and  most  natural  thing  for
managers  to  do,  yet  acquiring  new  employees  is  unlikely  to  solve  problems  in  an  immediate  way.  Lost
knowledge tends to be unique and even if it is possible to hire somebody who held a similar job elsewhere,
their  knowledge  would  probably  be  different  (Massingham,  2018).  To  make  matters  worse,  increased
competition  in  the  labour  market,  triggered  by  high  turnover,  may  result  in  new  hires  being  of  a  temporal
character.  If  they  are  not  emotionally  attached  to  their  new  organization,  they  may  be  easily  tempted  with
higher salaries or sign-up bonuses offered by competitors. The existing knowledge gaps can be filled in using
outsourcing.  This  can  be  perceived  as  a  step  towards  a  virtual  organization  (Durcan,  2016).  Employee-
empowering initiatives should also work, as they tend to boost organizational performance (Cillo et al., 2022).
Managers may also consider restructuring their organizations as a response to the difficulties they face. Proper
restructuration  allows  to  improve  intra-organizational  knowledge  flows  (Serenko,  Bontis  and  Hardie,  2007).
Additionally,  efficient  use  of  the  existing  employees’  knowledge  improves  their  self-perception  and  creates
bonds with organization, thus preventing from their quitting (Zhuo and Yuan, 2022).

3.  Quiet Quitting

The  Quiet  Quitting  is  a  relatively  new  phenomenon  and  publications  on  this  topic  are  still  scarce.  Although
used for the first time in 2009 by Mark Boldger, it remained widely unknown until recently (Yikilmaz, 2022).
The  name  itself  is  misleading  as  quiet  quitting  is  not  about  literally  quitting  one’s  job,  but  it  is  rather  about
performing basic duties of a job without going above and beyond usual expectations. Those who could afford
to leave their jobs formed the occurrence of the Great Resignation. Those who could not or for some other
reasons  decided  not  to,  contributed  to  the  Quiet  Quitting.  Unlike  the  Great  Resignation  phenomenon,  the
Quiet  Quitting  is  not  visible  in  labour  market  statistical  data.  Hence,  it  is  more  difficult  to  capture  and  the
challenge  of  measuring  it  is  much  more  problematic.  According  to  Gallup  poll,  quiet  quitters  may  have
constituted  more  than  half  of  US  employees  as  of  the  second  quarter  of  2022  (Harter,  2022).  Even  if  this
particular number is somehow overrated, the problem seems to be serious. Going beyond assigned duties and
being engaged in citizenship behaviours is often the source of competitive advantage of a company. the Quiet
Quitting may therefore lead companies to losing it. Additionally, employees not willing to go their “extra mile”
make it necessary for their colleagues to take increased burden of extra work (Klotz and Bolino 2022).

Considerations pertaining to the Quiet Quitting can be divided into two streams. The first one perceives quiet
quitting  as  a  sign  of  setting  the  right  balance  between  job-related  duties  and  private  life  (Nilufad,  2022;
Kilpatrick,  2022).  In  this  view,  quiet  quitting  is  just  a  response  to  the  hustle  culture,  where  overworking
becomes  a  norm  (Bunting,  2005).  The  other  stream  sees  quiet  quitting  as  being  disengaged,  precluding
passion,  and  real  interest  in  performing  job.  From  this  perspective,  quiet  quitters  do  not  contribute  truly  to
their workplaces and they use their behaviour as a way of expressing dissatisfaction with their job and working
conditions.  In  some  cases  it  could  be  even  a  way  of  exacting  a  small  scale  revenge  against  employers  or
managers (Klotz and Bolino 2022). On the one hand, the Quiet Quitting may be a serious threat to knowledge-
related processes in businesses, especially to knowledge sharing. On the other hand, it may also pose a major
ethical  challenge  in  some  cases,  such  as  social  workers,  where  this  problems  seems  to  be  systemic  (Astvik,
Melin and Allvin, 2014).

The  reasons  for  the  Quiet  Quitting  are  diverse.  One  of  them  is  lack  of  commitment  to  employees’  career
development.  Organisations  able  to  commit  to  professional  staff  development  and  their  job  satisfaction  are
also able to retain their employees. When organisations lack that ability, employees become uncertain of their
future  (Kruse,  2022)  and  they  perceive  the  current  job  as  a  dead  end  (Kelly,  2022).  That  leads  to
disengagement (the Quiet Quitting) or even leaving the job (the Great Resignation) (Hom, Allen and Griffeth,
2019).  Lacking  empathy  and  compassion  toward  employees  can  have  similar  effects.  Personal  commitment
appears  when  employees  know  the  organisation  cares  about  them  (Hamill,  2019),  which  includes  providing
what  is  needed  for  individual  well-being,  welfare,  mental  health  and  protection  (Clifton,  2022).  Yet,  in  the
post-pandemic reality, pressure on meeting high expectation at the cost of long working hours and work-life
balance  is  rather  common  (Klotz  and  Bolino  2022).  The  sense  of  disconnection  adds  a  lot  to  the  picture.
Employee  engagement  is  closely  connected  to  a  sense  of  belonging  (Anderson  and  Caldwell,  2020).  For
maintaining the sense of belonging, it is crucial to be fully informed and included in making decisions related to
their jobs. The COVID-19 pandemic transformed work environment, making remote work much more popular.
Remote work, however, brings isolation, loneliness and the feeling of disconnection (Luchetti et al., 2020), thus
contributing  to  the  Quiet  Quitting.  Last  but  not  least,  low  organisational  trust  is  possibly  a  powerful  factor
driving the Quiet Quitting. In recent years organisational trust generally deteriorates  (Edelman, 2022). On the
other  hand,  when  employees  are  not  included  in  problem  solving  and  decision  making  related  to  their  own
job, they perceive it as lack of trust from leaders and managers, which in turn leads to frustration and lower
productivity (Nwosu, Okoh and Goodluck, 2020).

On  the  basis  of  the  above-mentioned  literature,  the  following  model  of  the  Quiet  Qutting  process  has  been
proposed. As can be seen in Figure 1. the driving force for the Quiet Quitting is a job-related dissatisfaction. Its
main  source  is  the  discrepancy  between  the  actual  performance  of  an  employee  and  the  expected  one,
referred to as Performance Gap.

Figure 1: The Quiet Quitting Model – Causal Loop Diagram (own Elaboration Using Vensim PLE)

1519 Proceedings of the 24th European Conference on Knowledge Management, ECKM 2023
Krzysztof Zieba

Three important loops can be identified across the model. A reinforcing loop R1 is the main mechanism behind
the Quiet Quitting. When the Actual Performance is lower than the Expected Performance, the Performance
Gap  grows  and  results  in  increased  level  of  employee  Dissatisfaction,  which  is  turn  leads  to  greater
Disengagement  in  job-related  activities.  Lower  engagement  would  cripple  the  Actual  Performance,  making
Performance  Gap  even  bigger  and  thus  leading  to  intensification  of  the  problem  till  the  level  of  the
Disengagement leads finally to the Quiet Quitting. Within this R1 loop there is also a balancing loop B2 that
plays  an  important  role  stabilizing  the  situation.  While  dissatisfaction  increases  disengagement,  the  latter
positively  influences  the  Work-Life  Balance,  improving  the  mental  situation  of  an  employee  and  hence
reducing the level of dissatisfaction.

The character of the third loop (referred here to as B1) is not clearly determined. In the proposed model this
loop is a balancing one. In this view the Expected Performance may increase the Performance Gap, but when
that happens, norms and expectations towards employees are revised and adjusted (i.e. reduced). This would
lower  the  Expected  Performance,  producing  some  equilibrium.  However,  if  the  management  response  is
different (increasing pressure on employees by rising norms and expectations instead of lowering them), the
loop  becomes  a  reinforcing  one,  resulting  in  the    increase  of  dissatisfaction  and  finally,  contributing  to  the
Quiet Quitting.

When it comes to the Quiet Quitting prevention, the proposed model offers a few solutions for managers. The
most obvious one is connected to the causal loop mentioned above (B1). Workloads, expectations, norms, etc.
should be regularly revised and the expected performance should be benchmarked against the actual one. Job
creep  (gradual  increase  of  employee’s  duties  over  time)  is  entirely  natural.  Temporary  burdens  tend  to
become  permanent.  However,  during  pandemic  those  temporary  duties  were  often  very  much  “above  and
beyond”.  And  if  they  become  permanent,  they  may  erode  the  engagement  of  even  the  most  motivated
workers. Now it is the time to redefine core jobs tasks and calibrate job responsibilities to match sustainable
abilities of employees. The actions of management should be aimed at keeping the balancing character of the
B1 loop.

The  second  set  of  recommended  actions  is  to  provide  employees  with  the  sense  of  belonging.  Listening  to
their needs, and investing in workforce in general (not just in the key employees) is vital. The workforce is not
homogeneous, hence the need to offer them diversified support. One of the priorities should be setting safe
environment  where  employees  would  share  their  experience  and  have  confidence  that  management  is
dedicated to address their problems and concerns. The sense of belonging may significantly lower the level of
dissatisfaction, thus reducing the likelihood of the Quiet Quitting.

The  third  element  that  can  be  shaped  by  management  in  order  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  Quiet  Quitting  is  the
Citizenship  Fatigue.  Non-mandatory  meetings  that  are  actually  almost  obligatory,  the  culture  of  staying  late
and  showing  up  early  when  needed  –  all  these  may  lead  to  gradual  burnout.  The  suggested  solution  is  the
Citizenship  Crafting.  Those  additional  activities  can  be  matched  with  individual  preferences  of  employees.
Some of them may be motivated by, for example, public recognition and for them citizenship activities should
be  carefully  selected  to  make  them  visible  in  the  organization.  Others  may  be  motivated  by  helping  other
people  (both  within  and  outside  of  the  organization)  and  they  should  be  engaged  in  such  activities.  The
Citizenship  Crafting  is  therefore  about  making  the  involvement  in  extra  tasks  energizing  for  the  employees
rather than tiring, hence lowering the Citizenship Fatigue and improving the Actual Performance.

4.  Conclusions

How  common  the  Quiet  Quitting  is  and  to  what  extent  it  poses  a  problem  for  companies  and  national
economies  is  still  an  open  question.  Evidence  from  different  research  remains  contradictory.  While  data
obtained by Gallup suggest that even more than 50% of US workforce may be considered quiet quitters, data
from  Qualtrics  indicates  the  scale  of  the  problem  may  be  considerably  smaller,  ranging  from  10  to  20%,
depending on the industry. This is a significant discrepancy, but it may be attributed to the ambiguity of the
term and lack of standardise measurement.

That being said, we need to emphasize that hardly anything is known about the scale of this phenomenon in
other  countries.  Methodological  obstacles  and  doubts  about  how  to  detect  and  how  to  measure  the  Quiet
Quitting must be addressed by academics in order to promote research initiatives in other countries. The quiet
nature of this phenomenon makes it difficult to capture and therefore, it should make organizational leaders
really concerned about it. The disruption of the Quiet Quitting may be less visible and obvious than the one of
the Great Resignation, but it may be equally or even more damaging to businesses.

Both the Great Resignation and the Quiet Quitting can be - to a certain extent - prevented. And even if they
occur  in  some  organizations,  their  leaders  and  managers  have  possibilities  to  take  actions  mitigating  risks
those phenomena bring into organizations. What is needed, is the knowledge on how to do it, the openness to
notice when the first symptoms appear and the courage to introduce the changes that are needed. This paper
is aimed at providing some of the first of those three ingredients.
