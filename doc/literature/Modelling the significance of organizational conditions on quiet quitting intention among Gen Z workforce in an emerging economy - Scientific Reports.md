## Abstract

The phenomenon of “quiet quitting” has gained significant attention globally through various platforms, raising concerns about the impact of workplace stress on individuals’ personal lives and sparking social movements and investigations. As the number of Generation Z individuals is projected to surpass millennials by 2050, understanding and addressing the quiet quitting behaviour of this generation becomes crucial, considering their negative experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and their preference for a work-life balance, which has led to a rejection of intense competition and a desire for a more relaxed lifestyle. Thus, this study investigated the factors (work conditions, job security, perceived career development opportunities, affective organizational commitment, and perceived organizational support on job burnout and employee well-being) determining the quiet quitting intention among Chinese Gen Z employees. It used an online survey to obtain cross-sectional data from 683 respondents, which were then tested using partial least squares structural equation modelling. The results showed that work conditions, job security, perceived career progression opportunities, affective organizational commitment, and perceived organizational support had a significant positive effect on employee well-being and that job burnout had a major negative effect. Furthermore, employee well-being had a significant negative impact on China’s Gen Z employees’ quit quiting decision and job burnout had a significant positive influence on China’s Gen Z employees’ quit quiting decision. The findings provide valuable insights for organizations and practitioners, enabling them to address these factors and effectively reduce quiet quitting intentions. Moreover, this study aligns with the Social Exchange Theory (SET), which explains how the interactions between employees and their organizations influence expectations and outcomes. By considering the SET framework, organizations can understand the motivations behind employees’ behaviours and make informed decisions to foster a positive work environment and enhance employee well-being.

## Introduction

The term “quiet quitting” has recently become a growing concern in communities worldwide via a range of platforms. It has become the focus of many social movements and investigations. The objective is to continue working rather than quit, so that the stressful events at the workplace are limited to working hours and do not affect one’s personal life. According to some reports, the term first emerged in 2009, and was suggested by an economist, Mark Boldger. This claim is corroborated by numerous websites<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Daugherty, G.

A similar phenomenon was observed in the Gallup Report, which reported that the proportion of quiet quitters in the U.S. workforce is at least 50%, and in the second quarter of 2022, the ratio of engaged employees to actively disengaged employees was 1.8 to 1. Out of the total, 32% were engaged, while 18% were actively disengaged. According to Gallup’s longitudinal data, this marks the lowest level of engagement observed in the past decade<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 3" title="Formica, S. &amp; Sfodera, F.

Zaid Khan’s (@zaidlepplin) TikTok video was particularly effective in spreading awareness on this issue. The TikTok user explains quiet quitting as follows: the employees are not quitting their jobs outright, but they are quitting the idea of going above and beyond the bounds of their work. The concept contends that quiet quitting is akin to the ancient union technique of working to dominate. This involves doing no more than what the contract requires. Unfortunately, this leaves little time for work’s increasingly valuable intangibles such as teamwork, idea-sharing, and creativity. Quiet quitting and “actual quitting” can be distinguished by the level of commitment and the overt expression of intentions to leave the organization. Quiet quitting refers to employees who demonstrate limited commitment to their assigned duties, often sticking to the minimum requirements of their job description<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 5" title="Caldwell-Sergis, L., Brown, L., McCray, P. &amp; Neal, J.

Quiet quitters may gradually disengage without formally announcing their departure. On the other hand, “actual quitting” involves employees openly expressing their intention to leave through formal resignation processes or verbal communication<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 7" title="Ahmad, I. &amp; Begum, K.

By 2050, Gen Z (aged 18–28) is anticipated to surpass millennials in numbers, understanding and addressing the quiet quitting behaviour of Generation Z becomes imperative, considering that a significant portion of millennials are projected to retire by 2050. The quiet quitting phenomenon has had a stronger impact on Generation Z, as different generations have experienced the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in varied ways<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 9" title="Schawbel, D.

This transition was fraught with difficulties and significantly affected their mental well-being. Notably, a substantial number of them encountered career disruptions due to widespread layoffs.

Thus, ensuring that the employees are invested in their work is essential to retain them in their jobs.

The “quiet quitting” in China has come to stand for the silent opposition of the populace to official ambitions. Approximately 68% of undergraduates stated in a survey by the China Youth Daily in 2021, that they expect to earn one million yuan ($155,000) per year within ten years of graduation. However, this time is characterized by owing to a record-high rate of youth unemployment (19.9%) and pricey housing<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 13" title="Nan, L., &amp; Booker, A.

Notably, limited empirical study has comprehensively investigated this phenomenon on a global scale or in the Chinese context. Employing social exchange theory (SET) as a lens for this study can provide insights into how the variables, including work conditions, job security, perceived career development opportunities, affective organizational commitment, and perceived organizational support, are interconnected. While these variables have been extensively explored in the literature on career management, the focus has predominantly been on pre-employment and educational factors, with limited discussion on the role of post-employment and management factors in facilitating young people's early career transitions. Therefore, this study aims to address this research gap and contribute to a deeper understanding of how employees perceive quiet quitting and identify the driving factors behind it, aiming to mitigate the potentially detrimental consequences of employee disengagement.

This study aims to examine the effects of job conditions, job security, perceived career advancement opportunities, emotional organizational commitment, and perceived organizational support on employee well-being and job burnout, as well as the mediating effects of these factors on Gen Z’s intention to stay. For this, a comprehensive framework was developed and applied to Chinese Gen Z’s quiet quitting intention to fill the gaps in the existing literature. This research contributes to the academia and industry by providing the first empirical model to evaluate the global and Chinese quiet quitting intentions and by introducing new relationships to understand why employees quit without leaving physically. It helps organizations take proactive actions to reduce employee burnout and the intention to quit quietly.

## Literature review

### Theoretical foundation

The social exchange theory (SET), formulated by Homans, Blau, and Emerson in 1958–1959, has been used to explain employee behaviour in the workplace and its connection with social capital research, particularly networks, norms, and trust<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 40" title="Karen, S.

SET is a theoretical framework that describes how employee perceptions of job scope and rewards interact with one another<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 43" title="Afzal, S., Arshad, M., Saleem, S. &amp; Farooq, O.

When an individual considers that the cost outweighs the benefit, the activity is avoided. If people do not value continuing or connecting with work, or if they are sceptical because they do not receive any reward, the balance changes toward expecting a lower value for any social deal<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 41" title="Cropanzano, R. &amp; Mitchell, M.

Thus, elements such as work environment, job security, perceived career development opportunities, affective organizational commitment, and perceived organizational support, are founded on the SET framework, and they should be linked to job burnout, employee well-being, and a quiet intention to quit. SET can potentially explain how the appearance of perceived company support inspires better employee behaviour<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 40" title="Karen, S.

Owing to the difficulties in finding an acceptable theoretical model to comprehend quiet quitting intention, SET was chosen as an adequate theoretical model to analyse the quitting intention. A previous study also revealed that employee well-being may contribute to favourable behavioural outcomes such as lower turnover intention among employees<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 40" title="Karen, S.

Based on SET, the current study hypothesises that the effect of working conditions, job security, perceived career development opportunities, affective organizational commitment, and perceived organizational support on Gen Z’s quiet quitting intention is mediated by job burnout and employee well-being. As a result, this study creates a methodology for predicting quiet quitting intention among China’s Gen Z.

### Development of hypotheses

#### Work conditions, job burnout and employee well-being

Working conditions are implied to have two components in job analysis literature: dangers and environmental factors<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 44" title="Kahya, E. The effects of job characteristics and working conditions on job performance. Int. J. Ind. Ergon. 37(6), 515–523.

Environmental factors vary from common to extreme in terms of elements such as heat, humidity, sound, door, light, and dust. Harsh environmental circumstances have direct and indirect effects on employee performance. When exposed to such conditions, an employee’s ability to focus on duties declines, which leads to staff efficiency, low work quality, and emotional stress. Consequently, substantial costs are incurred. Risks, such as indirect or direct exposure to combustibles, light injury, burn danger, potential health risks from electrical devices, and deadly dangers, are often inevitable. Poor ergonomics are considered the primary contributors to workplace health risks and low levels of security<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 11" title="Aggarwal, A. et al.

The probability of accidents and injuries can be decreased by applying pertinent human-factor concepts. These effects lead to an increased absence from work and lower efficiency.

The literature on how work conditions can negatively impact mental and physical well-being is substantial<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 20" title="Mustafa, G. &amp; Ali, N.

It has been shown that inadequate workplace environments can lead to burnout, emotional stress, reduced employee satisfaction, physical complaints, and poor job performance<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 19" title="Bashir, A., Amir, A., Jawaad, M. &amp; Hasan, T.

This is probably a major contributor to high staff turnover, low employee satisfaction, and poor performance<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 20" title="Mustafa, G. &amp; Ali, N.

Workplace and employee happiness factors can be used to measure the efficacy of any changes or developments in the workplace. In addition, employees tend to perform better when the work environment is pleasant as it boosts their mood.

Recently, both practitioners and researchers have shown great interest in the well-being, a favourable psychological state that results from a person’s perspective, and the assessment of their life. Happiness and quality of life are two aspects of well-being; a multidimensional concept that involves physical, mental, social, and material well-being. Brunner et al.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 45" title="Brunner, B., Igic, I., Keller, A. C. &amp; Wieser, S. Who gains the most from improving working conditions? Health-related absenteeism and presenteeism due to stress at work. Eur. J. Health Econ. 20(8), 1165–1180.

They also suggested that if employees are in unfavourable settings with high work demands, no value or respect, and lack of social support, their health and productivity will be affected through absenteeism and presenteeism. Using the social exchange approach, this behaviour can be seen as employees attempting to make the employer-employee relationship more equitable. Consequently, two hypotheses were formulated to test these theories.

- H<sub>1A</sub>: Work conditions negatively influence job burnout.
- H<sub>1B</sub>: Work conditions positively influence employee well-being.

#### Job security

Job security has recently been studied in both Western and Eastern countries. According to Altinay et al.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 46" title="Altinay, L. et al. How to facilitate hotel employees’ work engagement. Int. J. Contemp. Hosp. Manag. 31(3), 1525–1542.

The study emphasized the significance of job security in the decision-making process of this demographic. Furthermore, job security emerged as a primary concern for employees and exerted a more notable impact on their inclination to leave the organization, outweighing the likelihood of engaging in quiet quitting behaviour<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 47" title="Stephens, K.

However, rapid organizational changes such as through outsourcing, mergers, and acquisitions, downsizing and restructuring can cause workers to feel increased job insecurity leading to powerlessness and burnout<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 46" title="Altinay, L. et al.

Turnover is just one of the many organizational behaviours triggered by anxieties, fear, and job insecurity brought on by ambiguous status, organizational or technical changes.

To explore this further, the following two hypotheses were proposed.

- H<sub>2A</sub>: Job security negatively influences job burnout.
- H<sub>2B</sub>: Job security positively influences employee well-being.

#### Perceived career development opportunities

Perceived career development opportunities are defined as individuals’ chance to know themselves in the context of their job, and how to act on that information more consciously and creatively through a systematic, sequenced, and wide variety of experiences<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 49" title="Davis, P. J. Implementing an employee career-development strategy. Hum. Resour. Manag. Int. Dig. 23(4), 28–32.

The process of designing a career path through education, training programs, and work experiences efficiently manages these plans<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 50" title="Arar, T. &amp; Öneren, M.

Career development distinguishes itself from the conventional career approach by laying the groundwork for personal career advancement, while maintaining stability in the company and industry. Job satisfaction deteriorates without a professional development structure, while turnover increases. The positive impacts of well-directed personnel would make this method useful in a competitive setting over the long term despite the immediate costs it could incur for the firm<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 49" title="Davis, P.

A cross-sectional study conducted in China found that employees who perceive greater career development opportunities are less likely to experience burnout symptoms such as emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 51" title="Wang, H. et al.

Burnout can be caused by job stress, which can make it difficult for individuals to fulfil their responsibilities in the workplace. Job satisfaction, career progression, and involvement in an organization have all been linked to decreased burnout<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 23" title="Kader, N. et al.

On the one hand, an employee may believe that there will be fewer options for them to work in the future. On the other hand, fulfilment is more likely to result in more optimistic ideas about future opportunities. The psychological contract of employees can inform them of the potential they have to reach their career goals, which can affect their job satisfaction and behaviour. Thus, the following hypotheses were proposed.

- H<sub>3A</sub>: Perceived career development opportunities negatively influence job burnout.
- H<sub>3B</sub>: Perceived career development opportunities positively influence employee well-being.

#### Affective organizational commitment

Meyer and Allen<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 53" title="Meyer, J. P. &amp; Allen, N. J.

Affective commitment or organizational commitment involves a deep emotional connection to identify with and participate in an organization. Affective commitment has stronger associations with positive outcomes, such as job satisfaction and lower turnover intentions, compared to the continuance and normative commitment. It reflects employees’ genuine emotional attachment to the organization. Affective commitment is closely related to employee well-being initiatives and work-life balance, and it plays a significant role in reducing burnout<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 54" title="Ahmad, A.

This study focuses on affective commitment to understand its impact on employee well-being, and engagement. An employee who feels obligated to stick to a firm in exchange for job stability is said to have a normative organizational commitment. Finally, continuing organizational commitment describes a worker’s need to remain with the company due to the perceived consequences of quitting.

Burnout also has significant dysfunctional effects that can have a notable financial impact on enterprises, including higher staff turnover, absenteeism, decreased productivity, and other personal issues. Some researchers such as Li et al.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Li, J., Bonn, M.

The following hypotheses are based on this assertion.

#### Perceived organizational support

The level of support an organization provides to its employees reflects how the organization values their efforts and well-being<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 57" title="Arasanmi, C.

When employees feel supported, understood, and their skills validated, it generates positive emotions and helps them recover from emotional fatigue caused by stressful work. Organizational support serves as an important external source of energy for employees, aiding in their emotional recovery during emotionally demanding tasks<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 58" title="Kurtessis, J.

This support includes assistance from managers, supervisors, and leaders in the workplace, and it stimulates high employee performance. Employees are drawn to organizations that fulfil their expectations in terms of their professional and personal ambitions<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 59" title="Khan, R.

- H<sub>5A</sub>: Perceived organizational support negatively influences job burnout.
- H<sub>5B</sub>: Perceived organizational support positively influences employee well-being.

Academics have considered job burnout as an explanatory mechanism for the associations between different stressors and turnover intention. Workplace pressures cause an adverse emotional reaction that results in job misery, which further motivates workers to retreat and disengage from their jobs to safeguard their psychological and emotional resources<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 60" title="Park, J., Min, H. &amp; (K.,.

To attract, inspire, and retain employees over the long term, there is a growing tendency to understand how human resource policies and practices affect job satisfaction. As employer branding and workplace connections are becoming important factors in organizational environments, profit development is no longer the main concern. Employers now give equal attention to employees’ well-being, work, and other factors. The “psychological contracts” idea, which has its roots in the SET, contends that principles of reciprocity and trade are at the core of employee-employer relationships<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 40" title="Karen, S.

Employees who feel deceived or their efforts are not acknowledged by the company may perceive this as a lack of gratitude for their accomplishments, which strengthens their desire to leave the company. In line with these arguments, we propose the following hypothesis.

- H<sub>6A</sub>: Job burnout positively affects the quiet quitting intention.
- H<sub>6B</sub>: Employee well-being negatively influences the quiet quitting intention.
- H<sub>6C</sub>: Psychological contract violation positively influences quiet quitting intention.

This implies that employees who have a positive work environment are less likely to consider leaving the company. As employees face continuous stressors at work, they become more susceptible to experiencing burnout and it transfers the negative effects of work conditions on quiet quitting intention. As job burnout increases, employees may perceive quitting quietly as a way to escape the overwhelming stress and demands of their current work environment<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 73" title="Wan, Q., Li, Z., Zhou, W. &amp; Shang, S.

Similarly, when job security is at risk, employees may experience heightened anxiety and fear of job loss, leading to burnout and subsequent quiet quitting intention, as uncertainty about the organization’s stability can prompt them to leave without explicitly expressing their intention.

Also, when employees perceive limited possibilities for advancement, they may feel stuck or stagnant in their roles, leading to feelings of disillusionment and burnout. Burnout, as a mediator, influences quiet quitting intention, as employees may decide to disengage quietly from their current position when they believe their career prospects are limited within the organization. As work conditions, job security, perceived career development opportunities, affective organizational commitment, and perceived organizational support is associated with reduced burnout and in turn a lower likelihood of quiet quitting<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 3" title="Formica, S. &amp; Sfodera, F.

#### Mediating effect of employee well-being

Employees are more likely to feel positive emotions and be able to recuperate from the emotional exhaustion when they feel encouraged, and believe their skills are valued. Employee well-being is positively impacted by work conditions, job security, and organizational support, which acts as a crucial external source of energy for workers, helps them emotionally recover during emotionally taxing duties, and supports their emotional recuperation<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 11" title="Aggarwal, A. et al.

Employee well-being, as a mediator, can transfer the positive or negative effects of these work-related factors on quiet quitting intention. When employees experience high levels of well-being due to supportive work conditions, job security, career development opportunities, affective organizational commitment, and perceived organizational support, they are less likely to consider quietly leaving their jobs. Conversely, the diminished well-being can lead to increased stress, emotional exhaustion, and a higher chance of considering quiet quitting as a way to escape the negative work environment. Consequently, we propose the following hypotheses.

- H<sub>9A-E</sub>: Employee well-being mediates the effects of work conditions, job security, perceived career development opportunities, affective organizational commitment, and perceived organizational support on quiet quitting intention.

### Data analysis method

In this study, the two-step data analysis process of PLS-SEM with Smart PLS (V4.0) software was employed. This multivariate analytical tool enables the analyses of path models with latent constructs and non-normal data. Unlike covariance-based SEM, PLS-SEM can handle complex models with composites without requiring a goodness-of-fit assessment owing to its predictive nature<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 89" title="Richter, N.

### Mediating and moderating effects

This study analysed the mediating effects of employee burnout on the intention to quit and work conditions, job security, perceived career development opportunities, affective organizational commitment, and perceived organizational support in the Chinese Gen Z staff. It further revealed that job burnout had a significantly negative effect (p < 0.05) on the variables and the intention to quit. Similarly, employee well-being had a significant (p < 0.05) negative indirect effect on the same variables and quitting intention. The results are presented in Table [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42591-3#Tab6). The findings revealed no moderating effect of psychological contract violation between job burnout and employee well-being on the quiet quitting intention.

## Discussion

This study examines the influence of various work conditions, such as job security, perceived career advancement opportunities, affective commitment to the organization, perceived organizational support, job burnout, employee well-being, and breach of the psychological contract, on the intention to quit without notice. Following a rigorous literature review, this study proposed a comprehensive research framework in which 25 hypotheses, including direct and indirect relationships, were proposed. The empirical investigation validated all the direct relationships (13) and 10 out of 12 indirect relationships. Thus, the proposed model fits well, as the explanatory power is strong (*r*<sup>2</sup> = 0.663). The discussion of each relationship is as follows:

This study confirms that the work environment has a significant influence on employee well-being and job burnout (H<sub>1A</sub> and H<sub>1B</sub>). This agrees with the previous study by Brunner et al.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 45" title="Brunner, B., Igic, I., Keller, A.

Specifically, employees often experience high levels of burnout and emotional stress due to an unfavourable workplace environment. Next, the findings of one study indicated that job security has a negative impact on job burnout and a positive influence on employee well-being (H<sub>2A</sub> and H<sub>2B</sub>).

### Mediating and moderating effects

The study’s findings suggest that the interaction effect of psychological contract violation on the relationship between job burnout- quiet quitting intention and employee well-being- quiet quitting intention was not significant (H7A and H7B). This means that the degree of psychological contract violation did not significantly modify the association between job burnout/employee well-being and the intention to quit quietly. It is crucial to consider the role of psychological contract violation in influencing the impact of individual and contextual factors. Specifically, the inclusion of Generation Z individuals in the sample may explain the non-significant findings. Research has highlighted generational differences in work attitudes and organizational commitment perceptions. Generation Z employees, known for their shorter job tenures and higher inclination to explore various job opportunities, may not perceive psychological contract violation as a betrayal or experience the same level of emotional attachment to the organization as other generations. As a result, the emotional impact of contract violation on the relationship between job burnout and the desire to quit as well as well-being and the desire to quit may be less pronounced among generation Z employees. This suggests that the interaction effects between the breach of the psychological contract and job burnout, as well as employee well-being, may be attenuated in this generational cohort. Therefore, the moderating influence of contract violation on the main relationships may be influenced by the unique characteristics and perspectives of different generations.

Additionally, our findings confirm that job burnout mediates work conditions, job security, perceived career development opportunities, affective organizational commitment, and perceived organizational support on quiet quitting intention (H<sub>8A</sub>\-H<sub>8B</sub>). These results suggest that when Gen Z employees perceive positive work conditions, job security, career development opportunities, organizational commitment, and support, it can potentially reduce the likelihood of experiencing job burnout. Therefore, organizations should prioritize creating a supportive work environment, providing career growth opportunities, and ensuring job security to mitigate job burnout and ultimately decrease the propensity for quiet quitting among Gen Z employees.

The findings of this study are supported by previous studies on the relationships between various work conditions and burnout symptoms.

Negative attitudes towards work, such as absenteeism and turnover, can have a negative impact on employee retention. These results suggest that employee retention is influenced by multiple factors, which collectively contribute to the overall outcome, including work conditions, job security, career development opportunities, affective organizational commitment, and perceived organizational support. To address these issues, the management should focus on improving work conditions, conflict management, communication, and provide more support to employees to mitigate the harmful effects of work patterns and arrangements. These interventions may help reduce the turnover rate and attract younger aspiring employees.

Finally, our data suggest that employee well-being serves as a mediator between work conditions, job security, perceived career advancement prospects, emotional organizational commitment, perceived organizational support, and the intention to quit one’s job. These findings support the idea that when employees experience favourable working conditions, such as the one listed above, they feel more content and experience a higher quality of life, which are both elements of well-being. This in turn increases their work engagement and performance, making them less likely to leave their jobs.

## Implications

This study makes several theoretical contributions to the relevant literature. First, this is the first empirical study to test quiet quitting intention based on employee perception. The previous studies on quiet quitting examined the preliminary aspects and were confined to conceptual development. The present study has come up with a detailed examination of organizational behaviour for the holistic understanding of quiet quitting behaviour. Second, this study seeks to add to the literature on organizational behaviour by taking a closer look at the world’s second-largest economy and the implications of quiet quitting intention on employee turnover, job satisfaction, motivation, and employee development. Third, the empirical validation of the proposed relationship in the Gen Z cohort will provide a comprehensive model for assessing quitting behaviour, and the scale generated can be replicated in various developed and underdeveloped economic perspectives. Fourth, the study offers new results and adds depth to the broader literature on violations. The previous study<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 29" title="Eckerd, S., Hill, J., Boyer, K.

The present study empirically tested the relationship and found no relevant moderating variable within the job burnout—quiet quitting intention and employee wellbeing—quiet quitting intention relationships. although this relationship was not established in the current study, it paves the way for investigating other cohorts or other country settings using the established scale. Fifth, many studies have tested the mediating role of job burnout and employee well-being within various relationships with turnover intention, work misbehaviour, and so on. The current study, for the first time, tested the mediation relationship with the quiet quitting intention, which will be a point of reference for future work relevant to the human resource management literature.

The study also offers practical implications for the practitioners. First, since the study’s findings indicate that the work environment is significantly related to employee well-being and job burnout, organizations should take further action to enhance workplace conditions, such as implementing “open days” to familiarize new employees with their working environment. This approach helps alleviate concerns related to health and safety among Gen Z workers and equips them with the necessary resources to be effective in their roles. Onboarding practices like “open days” also reduce the uncertainty and anxiety commonly experienced by newcomers, improving their understanding of their responsibilities.

Second, Gen Z employees, who have experienced the Great Recession, prioritize factors like wages, benefits, job security, work-life balance, and flexibility. Unlike previous generations, Gen Z tends to get bored with routine tasks and values career growth opportunities. It is crucial for organizations to identify their skills and offer job rotation programs that allow them to collaborate with other departments aligned with their interests, promoting skill development. Providing “realistic job previews” that demonstrate potential career advancement can help applicants make informed decisions and set realistic expectations. Managers should encourage employees to discuss their future goals, provide realistic avenues for professional growth, and assign challenging tasks to foster opportunities for development<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 98" title="Rudolph, C.

Third, the study emphasizes the importance of creating a supportive organizational culture that promotes employee welfare to ensure continued growth and dedication among personnel. Increasing emotional commitment and fostering a cooperative and empathetic work environment can reduce emotional weariness and ineptitude associated with job burnout, encouraging employee retention. To maximize the impact of organizational support, various human resource strategies should be adopted. These include implementing discretionary supportive workforce services, ensuring fairness and equity in management practices, setting achievable goals with appropriate rewards, offering individualized benefits, providing supportive training, and promoting strong social networks. Additionally, providing both material and non-material rewards directly reduce employees' intention to leave their jobs. Following the SET theory, when employees receive benefits that exceed their expectations, their employment becomes more meaningful. Thus, generating opportunities to improve employee well-being and welfare is critical. Managers should establish fair salary structures, and merit-based promotion criteria, and offer non-material advantages that align with employees’ abilities and tasks.

## Conclusion

This study aimed to comprehend the recent occurrence of quiet quitting intentions among the Chinese Gen Z. The evidence supports the notion that factors such as job environment, job stability, perceived chances for career advancement, emotional dedication to the company, and perceived company reinforcement significantly influence the Chinese Gen Z’s quiet quitting intention. This study created a comprehensive theoretical framework with eight intriguing components that influence Gen Z’s inclination to resign. This study also demonstrated that the social exchange theory is a good tool for estimating the probability of turnover among the Chinese Gen Z. In terms of practice, organizations should be encouraged to address the root causes of Gen Zs’ covert intentions to resign. For instance, emphasizing the importance of organizational commitment and support to develop a motivated and effective workforce. Additionally, the management needs to be aware that, over time, Gen Zs’ covert intent to leave can impair their performance.

Since the study had limitations, the findings are only suggestive rather than conclusive. First, the generalizability of the findings is limited by the small and specific sample size in the Chinese context. Also, it is often difficult to assess the representativeness of our obtained sample against the Generation Z population who are employed, as there are limitations in available statistics on this particular cohort in China.To gain a better understanding of this process in other contexts, it would be useful to replicate this study in other locations and sectors with a more representative sample based on the authentic population size.

Second, the cross-sectional design of the study did not allow for the determination of causal relationships between the variables. Future research using longitudinal data or experimental designs may provide further insight. Third, this study looks at employee well-being and job burnout as mediators, while future research may investigate other mediating factors such as work engagement and job satisfaction. To gain a more comprehensive and broader understanding of the factors contributing to quiet quitting, it would be useful for future studies to incorporate other constructs related to this phenomenon into the study model. This could provide a more nuanced and detailed understanding of the underlying causes and potential solutions to the issue of quiet quitting.

Fourth, this study did not find any moderating relationship psychological contract violation within the suggested relationships among Gen Z employees. Advanced studies in other settings can replicate the same investigation on other generations of employees, such as the millennials or older generations, to find its relevance in organizational behaviour research. Fifth, the limitation of this study is the potential for social desirability bias among participants. They may have been inclined to respond in a way that aligns with societal expectations and presents themselves in a positive light<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 99" title="Danioni, F. &amp; Barni, D.

This could have influenced the self-reported data, potentially underestimating the prevalence of quiet quitting intentions. To address this limitation, future research could use alternative methods, such as qualitative interviews or observational studies, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing quiet quitting among Chinese Gen Z employees. Fifth, one limitation of this study is that the study did not consider demographic variables such as age, and gender as a control variable. Future research should aim to incorporate demographic variables as control factors to better understand their potential influence on the relationships under investigation. Another potential limitation in our study related to the possibility of endogeneity in affective organizational commitment and perceived organizational support. Although VIF analysis indicated no serious endogeneity problems with the exogenous variables, there is still a conceptual concern regarding the influence of other factors within the research framework. Future research could employ advanced statistical techniques or alternative research designs to address this limitation and provide a more robust examination of such relationships.
